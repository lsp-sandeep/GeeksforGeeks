        This function returns all the unique permutations of the string
        
        Recursive Approach:
        1) Base case returns list of single character
        2) Iterative ignore each character and make a recursive call
        3) Append the ignored character to the end of the array
        
        Time Complexity: O(n*n!)
        Space Complexity: O(n!)
